# pkg-config support for GMock is in the master
# branch of the upstream repository.
# In order to be consistent with the upstream
# naming and the library conventions, the
# following changes have been made:
#
#   gmock_mainless_dep -> gmock_dep
#   gmock_with_main_dep -> gmock_main_dep
#
# Both GMock dependencies now include GTest,
# as this mimicks the same behavior as the
# upstream repo.
